Welcome to your comprehensive GitHub Copilot training journey for Visual Studio! These exercises are designed to progressively learn GitHub Copilot's features starting with foundational concepts and building up to advanced techniques through hands-on practice with our C# .NET project.

## Phase 1: Getting Started with Copilot Basics

### Exercise 1.1: Understanding Your Project with Chat Participants

**Welcome to the project!** Before diving into code generation, let's use GitHub Copilot to understand the project you'll be working with.

1. **@workspace Participant - Project Overview**
   - Open Copilot Chat in Visual Studio
   - Ask: `@workspace Tell me about this project?`
   - Try: `@workspace /explain Give me a comprehensive overview of this application`
   - Request: `@workspace What are the main features and components I should know about?`

2. **@workspace Participant - Code Structure**
   - Ask: `@workspace How are the files and folders organized in this project?`
   - Try: `@workspace Show me all the validation patterns used`
   - Request: `@workspace How are dependencies managed across the codebase?`

**Learning Goal:** Use the @workspace participant to get familiar with the project structure, setup, and workflow before starting development.

### Exercise 1.2: First Steps with Code Suggestions

1. **Explore Auto-Suggestions**
   - Open `Backend/WeatherForecast.cs`
   - Position your cursor after the existing properties and press Enter
   - Type `// Method to check if forecast is from today` and press Enter
   - Watch Copilot suggest a method implementation
   - Try accepting the suggestion with `Tab`

   - Cycle through alternatives: `Alt+.` (next) and `Alt+,` (previous)

2. **Practice with Comments**
   - Add this comment: `// Calculate the age of this forecast in days`
   - Let Copilot suggest the implementation
   - Notice how descriptive comments lead to better suggestions

3. **Experiment with Method Names**
   - Start typing `public string FormatTemperature` and see what Copilot suggests
   - Try `public bool IsHot` and observe the different suggestion

**Learning Goal:** Understand how Copilot uses context and comments to generate relevant code suggestions.

### Exercise 1.3: Exploring the Suggestion Interface

1. **Navigation Practice**
