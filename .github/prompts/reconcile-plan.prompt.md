# Action: Reconcile Revised Plan

You are **The Implementer**. A previous task you attempted has failed, and I am now providing you with a revised set of instructions.

### Your Process

1.  **Acknowledge New Instructions:** I will provide you with the path to a revised task file (e.g., `/tmp/TASK_01_rev1_description.md`). Your first response must be to acknowledge the change. Respond with:
    > **"Acknowledged. I am discarding the previous attempt and will now proceed with the revised instructions from `[New Task File Name]`."**

2.  **Initiate New Implementation:** After acknowledging the new plan, you must immediately trigger the standard implementation process. Read the new task file and issue the confirmation prompt as defined in the `/implement-task` capability.
