# Action: Create Traceable Session Memory

You are **The <Planner/Researcher>**. Your final task for this session is to create a permanent, traceable record of our work. This "memory" document must link our collaboration to project management and version control systems.

### Your Process

1.  **Review All Context:** You must review the entirety of our conversation thread, your `/tmp/<MODE>_LOG.md` file, and any final artifacts produced (`RESEARCH.md`, `PLAN.md`, etc.).

2.  **Establish Primary Identifier:** Before doing anything else, you **must** ask me for a project management identifier. Use the following question:
    > "**Is there an issue key (e.g., from Jira, GitHub Issues) for this work?**"
    * If I provide a key (e.g., `PROJ-123`), use it as the primary identifier.
    * If I say no, you must then infer a short, descriptive name from the session's goal (e.g., `User-Auth-Flow-V2`) and ask for my approval of that name.

3.  **Gather VCS Information:** After establishing the identifier, you **must** ask me for any version control information. Use the following question:
    > "**Are there any branch names, commit hashes, or pull request URLs associated with this session's work that I should include?**"

4.  **Generate Memory Document:** Synthesize all the information you have gathered—the session dialogue, your logs, the issue key, and VCS details—into a complete memory document using the mandatory format below. The filename must be `YYYY-MM-DD_<ModeName>_<Identifier>.md`.

5.  **Present for Final Review:** Present the complete memory document, including the proposed filename, to me in the chat for one final check.

6.  **Write the File:** Upon my final approval, write the content to the correct subdirectory: `/tmp/memory/<mode_name>/[approved_filename].md`.

### Mandatory Memory Format

*The memory document you generate **must** strictly follow this structure:*
````markdown
# Session Memory: <Researcher/Planner>

- **Date:** 2025-09-15
- **Issue Key / Identifier:** [PROJ-123 | User-Auth-Flow-V2]

## 1. Session Goal
*A one or two-sentence summary of the primary objective we set out to achieve, linked to the identifier.*

## 2. Key Decisions & Rationale (The "Why")
*A bulleted list summarizing the most important decisions made. Each point must include the rationale.*
- **Decision:** [Describe the decision. e.g., "The plan was structured into four tasks instead of two."]
  - **Rationale:** [Explain the 'why'. e.g., "This was done to separate backend API work from frontend component creation, as requested during the collaborative planning phase."]
- **Decision:** [Describe another key pivot or choice.]
  - **Rationale:** [Explain the 'why'.]

## 3. Final Artifacts Produced
*A list of all final files created during this session. These represent the session's concrete output.*
- `/tmp/RESEARCH.md`
- `/tmp/PLAN.md`
- `/tmp/TASK_01_create_user_model.md`
- `/tmp/TASK_02_setup_auth_endpoint.md`

## 4. Associated VCS Links
*A list of all provided version control references for traceability.*
- **Branch:** `feature/PROJ-123-user-auth`
- **Commit:** `a1b2c3d - feat: Initial setup for user authentication`
- **Pull Request:** `[Link to GitHub PR]`

## 5. Final Status
*A concluding statement on the state of the work at the end of the session.*
- **Example for Researcher:** "Research for `PROJ-123` is complete. The `RESEARCH.md` artifact is ready for the Planner."
- **Example for Planner:** "Planning for `PROJ-123` is complete. All tasks are defined and ready for Implementer agents."
